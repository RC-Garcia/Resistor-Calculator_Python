# Resistor-Calculator_Python

This project contains a Python script to calculate the needed resistor for a given load, input voltage, and operating current. The script helps determine the appropriate resistor value required to ensure the correct operation of a circuit.

## Description

The [script](resistor_calculator.py) calculates the needed resistor value using the following formula:
\[ R_{needed} = \frac{V_{input} - (I_{operating} \times R_{load})}{I_{operating}} \]

where:
- \( V_{input} \) is the input voltage in volts (V)
- \( I_{operating} \) is the operating current in amperes (A)
- \( R_{load} \) is the load resistance in ohms (立)

## Setup

1. **Download the Python File**:
   - Save the provided [Python code](resistor_calculator.py) to a file named `resistor_calculator.py`.

2. **Install Python**:
   - Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

## Usage

1. **Run the Python Script**:
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory where `resistor_calculator.py` is saved.
   - Execute the script with the following command:
     ```sh
     python resistor_calculator.py
     ```

2. **Input the Values**:
   - Enter the input voltage (V) when prompted.
   - Enter the operating current (I) when prompted.
   - Enter the load resistance (R<sub>L</sub>) when prompted.

3. **View the Result**:
   - The script will display the calculated resistor value in ohms (立).

## Example

***If you run the script and provide the following inputs:***

- Enter the input voltage (V): `12`

- Enter the operating current (I): `0.5`

- Enter the load resistance (R_L): `8`


***The output will be:***

Needed Resistor: `16.00 立`


This means you would need a 16.00 立 resistor for the given parameters.
